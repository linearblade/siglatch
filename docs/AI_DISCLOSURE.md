# ⚙️ AI Disclosure Statement

This project incorporates the assistance of artificial intelligence tools in a supporting role to accelerate development and reduce repetitive labor.

Specifically, AI was used to:

* 🛠️ **Accelerate the creation of repetitive or boilerplate files**, such as configuration definitions and lookup logic.
* ✍️ **Improve documentation clarity**, formatting, and flow for both technical and general audiences.
* 🧠 **Act as a second set of eyes** for small but crucial errors — such as pointer handling, memory safety, and edge-case checks.
* 🌈 **Suggest enhancements** like emoji-infused logging to improve readability and human-friendly debug output.

## 🧑‍💻 Emoji Philosophy

I **like emoji**. They're easy for me to scan and read while debugging. Emoji make logs more human-friendly and give structure to otherwise noisy output.

Future versions may include a **configurable emoji-less mode** for those who prefer minimalism or need plaintext compatibility.

And hey — if you don't like them, the wonders of open source mean you're free to **delete them all**. 😄

## 🔧 Human-Directed Engineering

All core architecture, flow design, function strategy, and overall system engineering are **authored and owned by the developer**. AI was not used to generate the software's original design, security model, or protocol logic.

Every AI-assisted suggestion was critically reviewed, tested, and integrated under human judgment.

## 🤝 Philosophy

AI tools were used in the same spirit as modern compilers, linters, or search engines — as **assistants, not authors**. All decisions, final code, and system behavior remain the responsibility and intellectual output of the developer.
