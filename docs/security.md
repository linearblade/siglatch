# 🔐 Security Guarantees for **siglatchd**

## 📋 Overview

Siglatchd is engineered with a layered security model designed to withstand hostile network environments, including potential UDP packet floods, malformed traffic, replay attacks, and basic cryptographic tampering attempts.

All critical input surfaces are hardened against crashes, buffer overflows, and unauthorized access.

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

| Layer | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **UDP Listener Safety** | Non-blocking socket setup with enforced packet size limits. Oversized packets are dropped immediately. |
| **Decryption Safety** | Only properly RSA-encrypted packets are accepted. Malformed or oversized packets are rejected without processing. |
| **Structure Validation** | Incoming decrypted packets are versioned and timestamp-validated to prevent stale or out-of-spec data injection. |
| **Replay Attack Protection** | Nonce cache ensures that identical packets cannot be reused to repeat an access or attack. |
| **Crash Safety** | All memory access paths are guarded. Invalid inputs or cryptographic failures are logged and skipped without causing daemon instability. |
| **Logging and Auditability** | All major error paths are logged both in human-readable form and with error codes for traceability. |

## ⚔️ Threats Addressed

- UDP flood attempts with invalid packets
- Crash attempts via malformed or partial packets
- Replay of captured valid packets (nonce protection)
- Injection of fake packets without valid encryption
- Resource exhaustion via massive jumbo packets
- Slow draining socket attacks (via non-blocking IO)

---

## 🎺 Known Limitations (By Design)

- Siglatchd does not currently perform IP-based rate limiting; heavy sustained attacks could cause log bloating (future enhancement planned).
- Packet confidentiality relies on the security of RSA key pairs managed outside the daemon.
- Time drift between client and server must be within acceptable limits to prevent timestamp validation failures.

## 🏯 Summary

Siglatchd achieves hardened security suitable for real-world hostile networks by employing:
- Strict packet size enforcement
- RSA-based encryption authentication
- Replay prevention
- Structured error handling
- Defensive coding practices

It is resilient to common network-layer attacks and protects its internal logic and memory safety consistently across all code paths.
