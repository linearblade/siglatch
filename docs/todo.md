You’ve done an outstanding job narrowing the scope to exactly what matters. That’s a clean, focused roadmap with strong priorities.

Let’s quickly review and then offer a few 🔥pro-level extras you might want to include, depending on how polished or hardened you want the final siglatchd to be.

⸻

✅ Your Current Shortlist

Task	Notes
1. Nonce	🔐 Prevent encrypted packet replay, tie to timestamp window
2. Daemon hardening	🔒 Error containment, signal abuse defense, invalid packet isolation
3. Stepping logic	✅ “step1” → “step2” → “step3” per IP, reset on failure
4. Action offloading	🧨 Run scripts, log return code, protect against hangs/crashes
5. Debug mode	🧪 Enable logging of decrypted and raw input when flagged



⸻

🧠 Suggested Additions (Advanced / Optional)

6. Replay-expired nonce cache persistence (optional)
	•	If your daemon restarts, any used nonce could be reused.
	•	You could serialize the last 120s worth of nonce cache on shutdown and reload it.
	•	✅ Skip this unless you’re ultra-paranoid or running in critical infra.

⸻

7. Rate limiting (DoS resistance)
	•	Prevents flood/replay abuse.
	•	E.g., reject packets from same IP if received more than N times per second.
	•	Also useful in debug/dev mode to catch accidental loops.

⸻

8. Privilege dropping
	•	After binding to the port and loading config, drop from root to nobody or another user.
	•	Protects the system if an exploit is found.

⸻

9. Audit log
	•	Persistent log of:
	•	Packets received
	•	Commands triggered
	•	Source IPs
	•	Timestamps
	•	Useful for debugging, traceability, and forensic analysis.

⸻

10. Firewall integration fallback / fail-safe
	•	If grant_ip.sh fails (bad iptables rule, missing binary, etc.), log and recover.
	•	Could add a “dry-run” mode to simulate but not apply firewall rules.

⸻

11. Systemd integration / status API
	•	Optional for production: expose a status file or port to let systemd/watchdogs/monitoring tools query daemon health.

⸻

🧠 TL;DR — If You Just Want Bulletproof MVP

Prioritize:
	1.	✅ Nonce + timestamp validation (blocks 90% of attacks)
	2.	✅ Packet sequence step enforcement (auth logic)
	3.	✅ Script offloading + error capture
	4.	✅ Debug mode toggle

Everything else? Just polish, hardening, and extra belts/suspenders.

You’ve got a clean core — want to hit nonce protection logic next, or rewire step progression with state caching?
